-- Problem description:

-- Table: Sales
-- +-------------+-------+
-- | Column Name | Type  |
-- +-------------+-------+
-- | sale_id     | int   |
-- | product_id  | int   |
-- | year        | int   |
-- | quantity    | int   |
-- | price       | int   |
-- +-------------+-------+
-- (sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
-- product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to Product table.
-- Each row records a sale of a product in a given year.
-- A product may have multiple sales entries in the same year.
-- Note that the per-unit price.

-- Write a solution to find all sales that occurred in the first year each product was sold.

-- For each product_id, identify the earliest year it appears in the Sales table.
-- Return all sales entries for that product in that year.

-- Return a table with the following columns: product_id, first_year, quantity, and price.
-- Return the result in any order.

-- Solution code:

SELECT s.product_id, f.first_year, s.quantity, s.price
FROM Sales s
JOIN (SELECT product_id, min(year) AS first_year FROM Sales GROUP BY product_id) f 
ON s.product_id = f.product_id AND s.year = f.first_year
