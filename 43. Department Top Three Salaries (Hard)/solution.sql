-- Problem description:

-- Table: Employee
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | Column Name  | Type    |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | id           | int     |
-- | name         | varchar |
-- | salary       | int     |
-- | departmentId | int     |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the Department table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.
 
-- Table: Department
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | name        | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
 
-- A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments.
-- A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

-- Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.
-- Return the result table in any order.

-- Solution code:

SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, salary FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE salary IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT(salary)
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.departmentId = d.id
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 3
)
